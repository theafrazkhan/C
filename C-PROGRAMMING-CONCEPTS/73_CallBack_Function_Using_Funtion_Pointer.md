In the previous lecture, we studied the function pointers. Let us revise the concept. In C programming, the pointer to a function is known as function pointer in C. In Functions Pointers, the function name can be used to get the function address. Function pointers can be useful when we want to create a callback mechanism and need to pass the function's address to another function. They can also be useful when you want to store an array of functions to call dynamically. To learn about function pointer in detail, check tutorial#72. Now let us move to the main topic of today's tutorial: Callback Function using function pointers.

## What is a Callback Function?
If a function's reference is passed to another function as an argument to call it, it will be called a Callback function. This allows the programmer to write less code and do more things. A callback function is a function that is called by using a function pointer. Function Pointer, as its name suggests, is a pointer to a function.

The following are some scenarios that help us in understanding the callback functions.

Let's say we have a function that downloads a file from the internet and takes a function pointer. When the download is complete or an error has happened, we would like to execute the callback.

``` c
void fileDownload (const char *file, void (*callback_function)(int statusCode));
```

Let us have another example; we have a function that sets up a callback function that is called when a click has been detected on a button.


### Following is the example of a callback function using a function pointer.
``` c
#include<stdio.h> 
 void A() 
{ 
    printf("I am function A\n"); 
} 
  // callback function 
void B(void (*ptr)()) 
{ 
    (*ptr) (); // callback to A 
} 
 int main() 
{ 
    void (*ptr)() = &A; 
    // calling function B and passing 
    // address of the function A as argument 
    B(ptr); 
    return 0; 
}
```

## Output:  
```
I am function A
```

## Difference between Function Pointer and Callback Functions

A function pointer is a pointer that points to the function. Whereas, callback functions are function pointers passed as parameters of the function, which can be called back when an event occurs.
A function pointer is an address of the function. Whereas, callback functions pass function pointer as an argument, and the caller would callback if something happens.
