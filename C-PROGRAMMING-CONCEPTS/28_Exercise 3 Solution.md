## The task you have to perform is “Array Reversal in C”.

## Instruction

In this task you have to write a C program that will reverse an array of integers. For that purpose, create the function that will take array as an argument and reverse an array.

### Your program should print the array before and after reversal.

## For Example:
```
Before Reversal: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 67
```
```
After Reversal: 67, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```
