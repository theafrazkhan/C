The task you have to perform is to write a program that will calculate the “Area of the Circle Using Function Pointers in C.”

## Problem Statement:-
You have to take four points(x1,y1,x2,y2) from the user using scanf(). To find the distance between these points, you will use the Euclidean distance formula. 

## Following is the task:

Write a function that will calculate the Euclidean distance.
``` c
int Edistance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
{
return 0;
}
```

This function will return an integer value.

Write a function that tells the area of the circle whose radius is equal to the distance between x1,y1,x2,y2, and pass function pointer as an argument.
``` c
float areaOfCircle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, <function pointer here> ){
//return area of circle
}
```
