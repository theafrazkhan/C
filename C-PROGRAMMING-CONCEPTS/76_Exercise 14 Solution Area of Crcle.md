Today we are going to discuss the solution of problem given in Tutorial #74. I hope that you have solved the problem and have learned the concept completely. The problem statement is again displayed below:-

## Problem Statement:-
You have to take four points(x1,y1,x2,y2) from the user using scanf(). To find the distance between these points, you will use the Euclidean distance formula. 

## Following is the task:

Write a function that will calculate the Euclidean distance.
```
int Edistance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
{
return 0;
}
```
This function will return an integer value.

Write a function that tells the area of the circle whose radius is equal to the distance between x1,y1,x2,y2, and pass function pointer as an argument.
```
float areaOfCircle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, <function pointer here> ){
//return area of circle
}

```
