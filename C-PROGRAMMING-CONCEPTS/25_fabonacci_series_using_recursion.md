## Question : Write a program using recursive function to produce Fibonacci series of numbers?

``` c
fib_recursive(int n):
     if n==1 or n==2:
         return n

     else:
      return fib_recursive(n-1) + fib_recursive(n-2)
 
```

So, here you have to simply produce Fibonacci series of no. 42 using both iterative and recursive logic.
