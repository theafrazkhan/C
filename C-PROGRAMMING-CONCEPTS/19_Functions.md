# Functions In C

## Functions
- Functions are used to divide a large C program into smaller pieces.
- Function can be called multiple or several times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.
- Functions are also called as procedure or subroutines.
- It is a piece of code to accomplish certain operation.
 

Now let’s understand in simple terms what function is?

Function is nothing but a group of code put together and given a name and it can be called anytime without writing the whole code again and again in a program.

I know its syntax is bit difficult to understand but don’t worry after reading this whole information about Functions you will know each and every term or thing related to Functions.

 

## Advantages of Functions 
- We can avoid rewriting same logic or code through functions.
- We can divide the work among programmers using functions.
- We can easily debug or can find bugs in any program using functions.
 

## Function Aspects :
There are 3 aspects of function

1. Declaration
2. Definition
3. Call
 

- A function is declared to tell the compiler about its existence.
- A function is defined to get some task done. (It means when we define function we write whole code of that function. In this actual implementation of function is done.)
- A function is called in order to be used.
 

## Types of Functions 
Library Functions – These are pre-defined functions in C Language. These are the functions which are included in C header files.
E.g. ```printf()```, ```scanf()``` etc.

## User defined Functions 
Functions created by programmer to reduce complexity of a program i.e. these are the functions which are created by user or programmer.
E.g. Any function created by programmer.

 



 

## NOTE 
Every C Program must contain one function i.e. ```main()``` function as execution of every C program starts from ```main()``` function.
