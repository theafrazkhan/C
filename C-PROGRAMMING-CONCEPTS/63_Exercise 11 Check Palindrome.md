```

The task you have to perform is to write a program that will check whether the integer number is a palindrome or not. A palindromic number is a number such as 16461, which remains the same when its digits are reversed. The example of palindromic numbers is 101, 131, 151.

Task:-
Create a function in which you will pass the number as an argument and the function return whether the number is palindrome or not.
```c
int isPalindrome(int num)
{
return 1;
}
```

Take the integer input from the user using scanf() statement. If the number is a palindrome, the message should display on the screen that “This number is a palindrome”.
