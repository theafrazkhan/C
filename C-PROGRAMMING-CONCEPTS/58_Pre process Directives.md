# C Pre-processor Introduction & Working
As we all know, what happens behind the scene in C programming. But before learning about pre-processors in C, it is quite important to revise the concept. Let us have a quick recap of whatâ€™s happening behind C program. The compiler converts the textual form of the C program into an executable file. There are four phases for the C program to become executable. These are Pre-processing, compilation, assembly, and linking. In pre-processing, it includes removing comments, expansion of macro, and expansion of include files. In the compilation phase, assembly level instructions are generated. Whereas in the assembly phase, the assembly level instructions are converted into machine code, and in linking, it resolves the function calls. In short, it links the function implementation. Now let us move to the main topic of this tutorial, "Pre-processors in C."

## What is a C Pre-processor?
The C Pre-processor is not a part of the compiler. The C Pre-processor is just a text substitution tool, and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation process. We refer to the C Pre-processor as CPP. 

Pre-processor directives like ``` #include ``` come into effect as soon as they are seen and keep working until the end of the file that contains them; the program's block structure is irrelevant. In C, Pre-processing directives are lines in the program that start with the hash symbol ``` # ``` The hash symbol ``` # ``` is followed by an identifier that is the directive name. For example, ``` #include ``` Whitespace is also allowed before and after the hash symbol ``` #``` The pre-processor in C does not know about the scope rules of C language. 

## The following table has all the important pre-processor directives:

 

| Directive | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| #include |This directive will insert a particular header from another file.|
| #define  | This will substitute a pre-processor macro.|
| #undef   | Using #undef, we can undefine a pre-processor macro.|
|#ifdef     | It will return true if this macro is defined.|
| #if      |It will test if a compile time condition is true.|
| #elif    | Using #elif, we can define #else and #if in one statement|
| #endif | It will end pre-processor conditional|
| #error | Using #error, we can print the error message on stderr.|
| #pragma | It will issue the special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method.|

 ## Pre-processors Examples
The following are examples of pre-processors in C.
```c
#define ARRAY_LENGTH 46
```

This directive tells the CPP to set the ARRAY_LENGTH with 46. 
```c
 #include <stdio.h>
 ```
These directives will get stdio.h from system libraries.

```c
#undef FSIZE
#define FSIZE 30
```
It will undefine existing FSIZE and define it as 30.

## Summary

The first step in compiling the C program is the pre-processor, a sort of automated editor that modifies our source code before passing it on to the compiler to translate into machine language code. One of the tasks of the pre-processor is that it removes all comments, which the compiler ignores. The pre-processor also responds to directives in the code like #define, #include or #elif, which give the pre-processor the instructions on how to edit the source code before passing it on to the compiler.
