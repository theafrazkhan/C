#Exercise 1 - Multiplication Tables: 
This is the first exercise of C programming tutorials. Your first task is to “Print Multiplication Table in C”. All of the concept we have studied till now will use in this task, so by solving this exercise you can examine yourself that how much effort you need to put in learning C language.

## Instructions:-
- Take an input (in integer form) from the user and print its multiplication table on the screen. Following is the example of the output.

## Input:
```
Enter the number you want multiplication table of: 6
```

## Output:
``` c
Table of 6.

6*6 = 36

6*7 = 42

6*8 = 48

6*9 = 54

6*10 = 60

```
Try to solve this exercise by yourself. These programming puzzles will improve your coding skills and makes you a good problem solver.
