## ``` No Source code available for this tutuorial ```

- Since the late 19th century, C has been a popular programming language for general-purpose use.
- C language was developed by [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) at [Bell laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) in early 1970s
- Its  applications are very diverse. It ranges from developing operating systems to databases and all.
- It is system programming language used to do low level programming [(eg. driver or Kernal)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))
- Even if it's old, it is still a very popular programming language. As the whole Unix operating system was written in C, it has a strong assosiation with the operating system.
- C also has also been used to write [ios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) kernels.
- [MYSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) is written in C.
- Most part of [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache) and [NGINX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) IS written in C.
- Embedded Systems are created using C.

## Why should we learn C/ Features of C?

- As mentioned above, it is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
- Learning any other popular programming language such as Python or C++ becomes a cakewalk already if you know C.
- C is a flexible language and that gets proven by the fact that it can be used in a variety of applications as well as technologies.
- C is very fast when compared to other programming languages be it Java or Python.
- C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot of Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.
- Being close to Machine language, some of its functions include direct access to machine-level hardware APIs.
- It is a structural language (Follows a specific Structure) /Compiled language this point should be added
- It is procedural programming language (POP) Procedural Programming is the use of code in a step-wise procedure to develop applications. 

## How is C different from C++?

- The syntax of C++ is almost identical to that of C, as C++ was developed as an extension of C.
- In contrast to C, C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.
- C gives most of the control to the hand of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient.
- C is [POP(procedure oriented programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) whereas c++ is [OOP(Object oriented programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
